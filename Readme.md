    - Download the third party source package to `smartnic_soc_sdk`.
    - Rename the third party source package as `preseed.tgz`
3. Generate a default configuration using following command
   - make defconfig
4. Install the missing build dependencies using following command
   - make deps
5. Copy the Debian packages which needs to be included in RootFS to imports/debian folder
   - cp \*.deb imports/debian/
6. Packages which needs to be pre-installed shall be mentioned in file imports/debian/install.list.
7. Use preseed file to avoid downloading third party source code again.
   - make import-downloads
8. Start compilation, This will take ~2 hrs for builds from a fresh checkout.
